"""similar to any other programming language python stores values in a variable and it can suport many types 
of data types
lets say we create variable called x and store integer value.
therefore every variable must have a name and value so we call the variable that store the intefer value as x_Int and 
store 10 as a value.
this means the python interpreter tells the computer to make a space in the memory so we can store a integer value
the following example will teach you several variable types"""

x_Int = 20 #this is a integer variable and it stores numerical values without decimal
print ("the value of x_Int is :", x_Int)#output: the value of x_Int is : 20

x_Int = 20.201#re-assign into a new value and add decimal points
print ("the value of x_Int is :", x_Int)#output: the value of x_Int is : 20.201
"""this means the python will decide whther the variable is float or integer based on the value"""


x_Float = 20.40#this is a float variable and it stores numerical values with decimal values
print ("the value of x_Float is :", x_Float)#output: the value of x_Float is : 20.4
